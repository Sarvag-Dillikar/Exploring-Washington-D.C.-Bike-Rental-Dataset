# Visual Exploration of Washington D.C. Bike Rentals

This notebook presents an in-depth visual analysis of the Washington D.C. Bike Rental dataset. The objective is to uncover meaningful insights through thoughtful, layered data visualizations, leveraging Python's data visualization ecosystem.

---

## Overview

This project is structured as a modular and readable notebook designed for showcasing data storytelling skills. It walks the viewer through:

- Initial inspection of the dataset
- Cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature exploration and correlation insights
- Visual representation of temporal and environmental trends
- Summary conclusions derived from visual evidence

The focus is on visual reasoning â€” how to interpret patterns, spot anomalies, and convey stories through graphs.

---

## Objectives

- Explore user behavior and bike rental patterns across different timeframes
- Identify influence of weather and seasonal attributes on rentals
- Evaluate trends based on working vs non-working days
- Present insights through clean, interpretable visuals

---

## Visualization Roadmap

The notebook follows a structured flow:

### 1. Initial Exploration
- Previewing data shape, types, and structure
- Understanding temporal granularity (hourly)

### 2. Preprocessing
- Feature extraction (hour, day, season, etc.)
- Categorization of working days and weather conditions

### 3. Univariate Analysis
- Distribution plots of rental counts
- Box plots segmented by categorical variables (season, weather)

### 4. Bivariate & Time Series Visualizations
- Line plots of rental counts across hours and months
- Heatmaps showing user behavior by hour and weekday
- Scatterplots showing weather vs rental patterns

### 5. Correlation Analysis
- Annotated heatmap of numeric feature correlations
- Interpretation of strongest influencing variables
